### ðŸŒ± My Interests
- **Backend Development**: Building scalable and resilient systems.
- **Microservices**: Crafting modular, independent services.
- **Reactive Applications**: Exploring reactive programming with frameworks like Lagom and Akka.
- **Data-Intensive Applications**: Designing applications that handle large data volumes.
- **Software Reliability**: Ensuring systems are robust and perform well under pressure.
- **Computer Vision**: Using AI for image and video analysis, particularly for object and keypoint detection.
- **Concurrency**: Building high-performance, concurrent systems in languages like Go.
- **Decentralized Systems & Cryptography**: Exploring distributed ledger technology (DLT), peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, and foundational cryptographic primitives (hashing, signing) for data integrity and secure communication.

### âš¡ Personal Projects
Here are a few projects I've built to explore new technologies and solve interesting problems:

* **[Food to Go - Reactive](https://github.com/JoseFerreira125/ftgo-reactive)**: A food delivery service, originally designed by [Chris Richardson](https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application), which I migrated and rebuilt with **Lagom** and **Scala** to focus on reactive principles and **event-driven architecture**.
* **[URLShortenerGo](https://github.com/JoseFerreira125/URLShortenerGo)**: A **high-performance** URL shortening service written in **Go**, utilizing concurrency primitives to showcase my ability to build **efficient and concurrent backend systems**.
* **[P2P-Ledger-Service](https://github.com/JoseFerreira125/P2P-Ledger-Service)**: A minimalist, **concurrent** distributed ledger written in **Go**. This project demonstrates expertise in **P2P networking (libp2p)**, Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, and utilizing concurrent Go routines for block mining and message gossip. It's fully containerized with **Prometheus/Grafana observability** and highlights solutions for **data immutability**.
* (In-progress) **TFT Analysis Project**: A computer vision and AI project to analyze Teamfight Tactics games. The goal is to detect in-game elements and evaluate player positions using models trained on custom datasets.
